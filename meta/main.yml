  # With the release of version 2.10, Ansible finally correctly
  # identifies Kali Linux as being the Kali distribution of the Debian
  # OS family.  This simplifies a lot of things for roles that support
  # Kali Linux, so it makes sense to force the installation of Ansible
  # 2.10 or newer.

    # FreeIPA server is only available for the RedHat, Fedora, and
